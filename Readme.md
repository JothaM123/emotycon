# Emotycon v1.0

Emotycon is a terminal-based emoji panel written for Linux. I simply created because I didn't find any default emoji panel in Linux. Just use Git to clone it. Then change directory. And `./emotycon.sh` and BOOM! Enjoy! 😃

Uh, and make sure you enable permissions. `chmod 701 emotycon.sh`

PS: Available emojis (You can change them...):
